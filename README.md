## Learning Goals

1. Create an HTML structure for an existing mockup

## Introduction

Web developers are often asked to work from a mockup of a potential webpage,
generally referred to as either a `mockup` or `comp`. In this lab, you'll be
asked to use a mockup image, source text and images, and create an HTML
structure that mirrors the mockup image.

## Create an HTML Structure for an Existing Mockup

### Tasks for LearnIDE Environment Users

1. Click the "OPEN IDE" button

### Tasks for Local Environment Users

1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone your fork locally.
3. `cd` into the local repo you just cloned.

### Process

In the `index.html` file, use the comments in the code to place the content
from `SOURCE.md` in the proper locations. The image file
[`MOCKUP.jpg`](https://s3.amazonaws.com/learn-verified/RIYADH-MOCKUP.jpg) can
be used as a reference to build the `index.html` page as it appears.

HINT: If you'd like to take a look at your handiwork as you go, and you're
working in the Learn IDE, you can preview the `index.html` file in your browser
by following [these steps].

### Bonus

Use CSS in the `style.css` file in the `css` folder to change different aspects
about your page such as:

* font color
* font size
* font family
* change the background image to a color
* change the background color to a gradient

You can also try modifying these styles on-the-fly by modifying them with the
[developer tools] of your [browser].

You might think: "BUT I DON'T KNOW CSS (_very well_ or _at all_). Developers
*constantly* encounter this feeling. Since developers are constantly learning,
we try to keep the commands as simple as possible. You might know more than you
think! What happens if you change `red` to `green`? What do you expect? How
would you validate your guess? Developers usually call this process "trying
stuff" or "messing around" or "playing with stuff." While all those phrases
sound like a joke, what they mean to say is that they're using the Scientific
Method to validate their guesses into building a model.

It's possibly the most powerful learning technique possible. Toddlers and
puppies are amazing at it!
